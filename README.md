#This is a course project for getting and cleaning data. There are 3 other files in the repo in addition to this **README.md** file:#

1. The **CoodBook.md** file containing information of the data, variables, and steps of analysis and data transformation to get the output data required.

2. The **run_analysis.R** file containing the script to download and read the data, perform the required steps of extracting the data and taking the average by variable and by subject. This script will download the require data set from <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip> and save it to your /data subdirectory as **./data/project.zip**, then perform the required analysis.

3. The output data file **tidy_output.txt** as a result of running **run_analysis.R**.
